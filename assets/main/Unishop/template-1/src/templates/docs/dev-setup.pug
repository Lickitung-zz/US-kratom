          | <strong>Please note:</strong> this step is absolutely optional. It aims for advanced user who want to speed up development process with professional grade Front-End toolset shiped with Unishop. If you are not familiar with these tools and have no time to dive in you can still use plain HTML / CSS / JS to customize Unishop. Files you need are located inside <code>Unishop/dist</code> folder. In this case you can skip this and next sections. Happy coding :)
        p Unishop is built using modern development toolset.
